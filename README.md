Monads.jl: Julia Monad Expressions
==================================

A straightforward (but no longer syntactically valid) implementation of monads, complete with Haskell-style syntactic sugar implemented by a Julia macro.

This package was an experiment and pedagogical exercise, is now deprecated, and will not load in released versions of Julia.
